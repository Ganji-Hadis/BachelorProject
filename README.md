Sitting Position and Energy Management Device: An Arduino-based Solution for Improved Health and Sustainable Electricity Consumption
 In this final bachelor's thesis project, we utilized an Arduino board along with ultrasonic sensors, a temperature sensor, a lamp, relay, and LEDs to improve the user's reading and sitting environment. By detecting the user's position with ultrasonic sensors, we prompted them to correct their posture by automatically turning off the lamp using the relay. Moreover, we incorporated a temperature sensor to monitor the environment, and if it became too hot or too cold, we alerted the user through the LEDs. This innovative system provided a comfortable and conducive environment for reading and sitting, enhancing the overall user experience effectively.
